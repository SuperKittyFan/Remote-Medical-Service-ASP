# Remote Service System of Gastrointestinal Functional Disease

This study intends to develop a big-data service platform for the newest medical devices, which is used to detect gastrointestinal functional diseases. This platform serves medical researchers who are responsible for long-distance data sharing, searching, and analyzing. The system is based on Windows Server 2008 + IIS 7.5 + ASP.NET + SQL Server 2008 platform. We use Visual Studio 2012 for Front-end development. HTML+CSS is used to design the style and the appearance of the web pages. ASP.Net and C# is used to design the back-end interaction. ADO.NET is used to realize the transmission between the back-end and the database. SQL Server is used to build the relational database. Doctors who operates the medical devices will be responsible for adding data into the database. Researchers can use this platform to download the medical data and therefore analyze them. This big-data system significantly improves the efficiency of researchers who previously have to collect data from different places and devices. Furthermore, this platform can be extended. It can be developed into a systematic domestic medical Big-data system.
